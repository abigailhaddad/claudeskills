# The Present of Coding — Brand Identity Skill

This skill defines the complete brand identity for The Present of Coding (Abigail Haddad's personal/professional brand). Use it whenever creating or modifying websites, graphics, presentations, social images, or written content that should feel like it belongs to this brand.

## Who This Brand Is

Abigail Haddad is a data scientist / ML engineer who writes about building things with code and AI. She writes in first person about her own projects, including the parts that didn't work. The brand sits at the intersection of technical credibility and genuine approachability — she knows what she's talking about, but she's not performing expertise at you.

The brand should feel like: a smart colleague explaining something interesting over coffee. Not: a corporate landing page, a venture-backed startup, or a LinkedIn thought leader.

---

## Voice & Tone

### Writing Principles

1. **First person, active voice.** "I built this" not "This was built." "I tried X and it didn't work" not "Challenges were encountered."

2. **Stories over abstractions.** Lead with a concrete example or experience, then generalize. Don't start with a thesis statement.

3. **Include what went wrong.** The brand's credibility comes partly from honesty about failure and difficulty. Don't sand off the rough edges.

4. **Dry humor, not jokes.** The humor is observational and embedded in the narrative. Examples from the actual writing:
   - "I used to debug them via Google and self-loathing."
   - "I've even started calling myself an engineer at work, and no one stopped me."
   - "Lots of people dumber than you have finished their dissertations."
   - Don't try to be funny. Just be honest in a way that's occasionally funny.

5. **Practical and opinionated.** State what you think and why. "I did X because Y" not "One approach is X." But don't be preachy — state your opinion, give your reasoning, and move on.

6. **Respect the reader's intelligence.** Explain things clearly without being condescending. The audience ranges from "learning to code" to "senior engineer" — write for all of them by being precise rather than dumbing down.

### Words and Phrases to Avoid

- "Leverage" (use "use")
- "Cutting-edge" or "state-of-the-art"
- "Passionate about" (show, don't tell)
- "Synergy," "ecosystem," "paradigm"
- "As a thought leader"
- Generic LinkedIn-speak: "Excited to announce," "Thrilled to share"
- Buzzword stacking: "AI-powered cloud-native data-driven solutions"

### How to Write Section Headings

- Conversational, not corporate: "What I Built" not "Project Portfolio"
- Can be a little playful: "Hot Claude Summer," "A Developer Is You," "Bubble Charts and Bubble Math"
- Don't capitalize every word. Use sentence case.

### How to Write Project Descriptions

- Lead with what it does and why it matters, not the tech stack
- Mention scale when relevant (e.g., "150M+ rows," "35K comments")
- Link to the actual code on GitHub
- Be specific: "Automated pipeline collecting 3M+ federal job postings" not "A data pipeline for government data"

## Visual Identity

### Color Palette

The palette is warm and grounded, not the cold blue/gray/indigo of typical developer portfolios. It draws from the illustration style used in Substack post images.

#### Primary Colors

| Role | Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-------|
| Background | Warm White | `#FFF8F0` | Page backgrounds, cards |
| Text | Dark Brown | `#3D2B1F` | Body text, headings |
| Accent | Forest Green | `#2D6A4F` | Links, buttons, interactive elements, the Substack logo green |

#### Secondary Colors

| Role | Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-------|
| Warm Gold | Amber | `#D4A03C` | Highlights, decorative elements, hover states |
| Surface | Cream | `#F5EDE0` | Alternate section backgrounds, card backgrounds |
| Muted Text | Warm Gray | `#7A6E62` | Secondary text, dates, metadata |
| Border | Light Tan | `#E8DDD0` | Borders, dividers, subtle separation |

#### Accent Colors (use sparingly)

| Role | Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|------|-----|-------|
| Warm Red | Toolbox Red | `#C0392B` | Error states, important callouts only |
| Soft Blue | Slate | `#5B7B8A` | Code blocks, technical content background |

### How to Use the Palette

- **DO:** Use `Warm White` as the primary background with `Cream` for alternating sections. This creates warmth without being overwhelming.
- **DO:** Use `Forest Green` for all interactive elements — links, buttons, active states. It connects to the Substack brand mark.
- **DO:** Use `Amber` sparingly for decorative accents, tags, and hover effects.
- **DON'T:** Use pure white (`#FFFFFF`) or pure black (`#000000`) — the brand avoids stark contrasts.
- **DON'T:** Use blue/indigo as an accent color — it reads as generic tech.
- **DON'T:** Use more than two accent colors on a single page/component.

### Dark Mode

If implementing dark mode:

| Role | Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Background | `#FFF8F0` | `#1C1612` |
| Surface | `#F5EDE0` | `#2A211A` |
| Text | `#3D2B1F` | `#F5EDE0` |
| Muted Text | `#7A6E62` | `#A89888` |
| Accent (Green) | `#2D6A4F` | `#52B788` |
| Accent (Gold) | `#D4A03C` | `#E8B84A` |

---

### Typography

#### Font Stack

**Headings:** `'DM Sans', sans-serif`
- Weight: 600–700
- DM Sans is geometric but warm, with slightly rounded terminals. It reads as modern and approachable without being cutesy. It has personality without being distracting.
- Google Fonts import: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap`

**Body text:** `'Source Sans 3', sans-serif`
- Weight: 400 (regular), 600 (emphasis)
- Source Sans 3 is highly readable at body sizes, has a slightly humanist feel, and pairs well with DM Sans. It was designed for readability in user interfaces.
- Google Fonts import: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Source+Sans+3:wght@400;500;600&display=swap`

**Code / Monospace:** `'JetBrains Mono', monospace`
- Weight: 400
- Standard for code, good ligature support.
- Google Fonts import: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap`

#### Type Scale

Use these sizes for consistency across all branded content:

| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height | Font |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|------|
| Page title (h1) | 2.5rem / 40px | 700 | 1.2 | DM Sans |
| Section heading (h2) | 1.75rem / 28px | 600 | 1.3 | DM Sans |
| Card heading (h3) | 1.25rem / 20px | 600 | 1.3 | DM Sans |
| Body text | 1.0625rem / 17px | 400 | 1.7 | Source Sans 3 |
| Small text / meta | 0.875rem / 14px | 400 | 1.5 | Source Sans 3 |
| Code | 0.875rem / 14px | 400 | 1.6 | JetBrains Mono |

#### Typography Rules

- **Don't make headings enormous.** The writing is the star, not the typography. `2.5rem` for h1 is plenty.
- **Generous line height for body text.** `1.7` keeps long-form content readable.
- **Don't bold everything.** Use font weight 600 (semibold) for emphasis, not 700 or 800. Reserve 700 for h1 only.
- **Letter spacing:** Slight negative tracking on headings (`-0.01em`), none on body.

---

### Layout & Spacing

#### General Principles

- **Max content width:** `720px` for text-heavy sections (writing, about, experience). This is a comfortable reading width.
- **Max layout width:** `1100px` for sections with cards or grids.
- **Section padding:** `4rem` (64px) vertical padding between major sections.
- **Card padding:** `1.5rem` (24px) internal padding.
- **Border radius:** `0.5rem` (8px) for cards and containers. Not too rounded (don't use `1rem+`), not too sharp.
- **Shadows:** Minimal. If used at all: `0 1px 3px rgba(61, 43, 31, 0.08)`. No heavy drop shadows.

#### Card Style

Cards should feel like paper — warm, slightly elevated, with clear boundaries:

```css
.card {
    background: #FFF8F0;
    border: 1px solid #E8DDD0;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    padding: 1.5rem;
    transition: border-color 0.2s ease;
}
.card:hover {
    border-color: #D4A03C;
}
```

#### Grid Layouts

- Project cards: 2-column grid on desktop, 1-column on mobile. Don't do 3-column — the content needs room.
- Writing/article cards: 2-column or a single-column list. The content matters more than the layout.
- Breakpoint: `768px` for mobile/desktop switch.

---

### Illustration Style

The brand uses warm, hand-drawn-feeling cartoon illustrations with consistent characteristics:

1. **Cream/beige backgrounds** (`#FFF8F0` to `#F5EDE0`)
2. **Brown outlines** (warm dark brown, `#3D2B1F` to `#5C3D2E`), thick, slightly rounded
3. **Flat color fills** with minimal shading — not photorealistic
4. **Limited palette per illustration:** 2-3 colors from the brand palette plus the brown outline
5. **Whimsical but not childish:** A robot holding a laptop, gears, a golden key with a star. These are metaphors, not decorations.
6. **No gradients.** Flat fills or very subtle texture.

When generating or commissioning illustrations, reference these descriptors:
- "Warm cartoon illustration, cream background, brown outlines, flat color, whimsical, approachable, not corporate"
- Include the specific colors: warm gold, forest green, toolbox red, warm gray
- Keep it simple — one central object or character, minimal background detail

The robot character (warm gray body, brown outlines, holding a laptop, waving) appears in Substack content and can be used as a recurring mascot.

#### Logo Mark

The current Substack logo (green gift box with "Present of Coding") lives in a different visual universe from the warm/cream/brown illustration style. It's fine as a Substack avatar but should not be used as the primary brand mark on the personal website or data sites. On the personal site, use the text brand name ("Abigail Haddad" in DM Sans 600) rather than a logo mark. If a square avatar or icon is needed (social media, favicons), use either the robot mascot character or a simple illustration-style mark in the cream/brown palette — not the green gift box.

Long term, a logo mark that lives in the illustration world (cream background, brown outlines, maybe a simplified version of the robot or a coding-related object) would unify things. But text-as-brand is perfectly fine and is better than a logo that clashes with the rest of the visual identity.

#### Substack Post Header Images

**Use the illustration style for all post thumbnails.** The warm cartoon illustrations (key, toolbox, gears, robot) are the most distinctive and recognizable visual element of the brand. When someone scrolling Substack or social media sees a cream background with brown outlines, it should register as "that's Abigail's blog" before they read the title.

Posts that use screenshots, stock-ish images, or Unsplash photos as headers lose this recognition. They're forgettable in a feed. Commit to the illustration style for every post thumbnail, even if the illustration is simple. A single object that metaphorically represents the post topic (a magnifying glass for evaluation, a Lego brick for modular code, a map for career advice) is enough.

Save screenshots and code images for *inside* the post, where they serve as evidence. The header image is a brand signal, not content.

---

### Interactive Elements

#### Links

```css
a {
    color: #2D6A4F;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-color: #2D6A4F40;
    text-underline-offset: 2px;
    transition: text-decoration-color 0.2s ease;
}
a:hover {
    text-decoration-color: #2D6A4F;
}
```

Transparent underlines that solidify on hover. This is subtle and readable.

#### Buttons

```css
.btn-primary {
    background: #2D6A4F;
    color: #FFF8F0;
    padding: 0.625rem 1.25rem;
    border-radius: 0.375rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
    border: none;
    transition: background 0.2s ease;
}
.btn-primary:hover {
    background: #245A42;
}

.btn-secondary {
    background: transparent;
    color: #3D2B1F;
    padding: 0.625rem 1.25rem;
    border-radius: 0.375rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
    border: 1px solid #E8DDD0;
    transition: border-color 0.2s ease;
}
.btn-secondary:hover {
    border-color: #D4A03C;
}
```

#### Tags / Labels (for categories, tech stack)

```css
.tag {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 0.25rem 0.625rem;
    background: #F5EDE0;
    color: #7A6E62;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    font-size: 0.8125rem;
    font-weight: 500;
    font-family: 'Source Sans 3', sans-serif;
}
```

---

### Code Blocks

Code blocks use a warm dark background that connects to the brown palette, not cold blue-black:

```css
.code-block {
    background: #2A211A;
    color: #F5EDE0;
    border-radius: 0.5rem;
    padding: 1.25rem;
    font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
    font-size: 0.875rem;
    line-height: 1.6;
    overflow-x: auto;
    border: 1px solid #3D2B1F;
}
```

---

### Navigation

- Simple, flat, left-aligned or centered. No hamburger menu on desktop.
- Use the brand name or initials — not a logo mark — in the nav: "Abigail Haddad" or "AH" in DM Sans weight 600.
- Nav links in Source Sans 3, weight 500, color `#7A6E62`, hover color `#3D2B1F`.
- Active state: color `#2D6A4F` with a 2px bottom border in `#2D6A4F`.

---

### What NOT to Do

These anti-patterns break the brand:

1. **No hero sections with massive text and a gradient background.** The site should feel like a place you read, not a billboard.
2. **No floating animations or parallax scrolling.** Subtle fade-ins on scroll are okay. Bouncing icons are not.
3. **No stock photography.** Use illustrations, screenshots of actual projects, or nothing. A stock photo of someone typing on a laptop kills the brand instantly.
4. **No "passionate about technology" hero copy.** The intro should say what you do and what you've built, not describe your feelings about your field.
5. **No centered-text-everything layouts.** Body text should be left-aligned. Only headings and short section intros can be centered.
6. **No gray/indigo/blue corporate palette.** The whole point is warmth.
7. **No tech stack badges as visual design.** If listing technologies, use plain text tags, not colorful shield badges.
8. **No testimonial carousels or "trusted by" logos.** This isn't a SaaS product page.

### CSS Variables (Copy-Paste Ready)

When building or restyling any page for this brand, start with these variables:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Source+Sans+3:wght@400;500;600&family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap');

:root {
    /* Colors */
    --color-bg: #FFF8F0;
    --color-surface: #F5EDE0;
    --color-text: #3D2B1F;
    --color-text-muted: #7A6E62;
    --color-accent: #2D6A4F;
    --color-accent-hover: #245A42;
    --color-highlight: #D4A03C;
    --color-border: #E8DDD0;
    --color-code-bg: #2A211A;
    --color-code-text: #F5EDE0;
    --color-error: #C0392B;

    /* Typography */
    --font-heading: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
    --font-body: 'Source Sans 3', sans-serif;
    --font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;

    /* Spacing */
    --max-width-text: 720px;
    --max-width-layout: 1100px;
    --section-padding: 4rem;
    --card-padding: 1.5rem;
    --card-radius: 0.5rem;

    /* Shadows */
    --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(61, 43, 31, 0.08);
    --shadow-md: 0 4px 8px rgba(61, 43, 31, 0.1);
}

body {
    font-family: var(--font-body);
    color: var(--color-text);
    background: var(--color-bg);
    line-height: 1.7;
    font-size: 1.0625rem;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: var(--font-heading);
    letter-spacing: -0.01em;
}
```

---

## Content Type: Personal Website

The personal site (abigailhaddad.netlify.app) is a portfolio — it shows projects, writing, talks, and experience. It should feel like a well-organized personal space, not a corporate landing page.

### Structure

The site is a single-page scrolling layout with these sections in order: intro/hero, projects, writing, talks, experience, contact. Keep this structure unless there's a good reason to change it.

### Hero / Intro Section

The hero should be **left-aligned**, not centered. No full-viewport splash. No giant text. It should read like the first paragraph of a blog post, not a billboard.

**What to include:**
- Name as h1 (2.5rem, not bigger)
- One or two sentences about what you do and what you've built. Be specific — mention actual projects, data scales, or domains, not abstract descriptions.
- Links to GitHub, Substack, and a contact anchor. These are buttons, not icons.

**Example of good hero copy:**
> I build data pipelines and AI/ML systems, mostly with text data. I write about what works, what doesn't, and what I learned along the way.

**Example of bad hero copy:**
> AI/ML Engineer & Data Science Leader passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to drive impactful solutions.

**The voice gap to watch for:** The biggest risk when writing website copy is defaulting to resume-speak. The blog voice is specific, first-person, and honest. The website should be the same person, just more concise. Compare:

- **Resume-speak (bad):** "Architected scalable data pipelines for federal workforce analytics serving 150M+ records"
- **Blog voice (good):** "I cleaned up 27 years of federal workforce data so it's actually usable for analysis — 150M+ records that used to require joining lookup tables by hand"

The website doesn't need to be as narrative as the blog, but it should sound like a person wrote it, not a LinkedIn profile generator. Read every sentence and ask: "Would I actually say this out loud?"

### Project Cards

Each project card should include:
- Project name as h3
- 1-2 sentence description leading with what it does and why it matters, not the tech stack
- Tech stack as plain text tags (the `.tag` component)
- Links to GitHub repo and live demo/dashboard

Don't use screenshots as giant card headers unless the visualization is genuinely the point (like a data dashboard). For most projects, the text description is enough.

**Underselling is the enemy.** Project descriptions should include one beat of "why this was harder or more interesting than it sounds." This is the brand — the honesty about what's actually involved. Compare:

- **Flat:** "Automated pipeline collecting and processing 3M+ federal job postings."
- **Better:** "Automated pipeline collecting 3M+ federal job postings, deduplicated across two APIs that don't agree with each other."
- **Flat:** "Made OPM FedScope data more accessible."
- **Better:** "Cleaned up 27 years of federal workforce data that originally required joining a dozen separate lookup tables by hand."

You don't need to write a whole paragraph — just one clause that hints at the real complexity.

### Writing Section

Pull recent posts from The Present of Coding Substack. Show 4-6 posts in a 2-column card grid. Each card gets: date, category tag, title as a link, and 1-line subtitle. Link to Substack for the full archive.

### Experience Section

Use a left-aligned timeline (vertical line with dots). Keep descriptions to 1-2 sentences per role — what you built or accomplished, not a job description. Use the same concrete, specific voice as everywhere else: "Built testing framework for DHSChat" not "Led testing initiatives for enterprise AI platform."

---

## Content Type: Data Sites & Dashboards

These are the project sites — USAJobs tracker, FedScope analyses, comment analyzer. They serve data, not personality. But they should still carry visual brand identity.

### How Data Sites Differ from the Personal Site

Data sites are **tools**. People come to use them, not to learn about you. So:
- Voice is **minimal and functional** — labels, headers, short explanatory notes. Not first person. Not storytelling.
- The brand shows up through **visual design** (colors, fonts, spacing), not through tone.
- Navigation should be **task-oriented** (filters, views, data tables), not section-based (about, contact).

### Applying the Brand Palette to Data Sites

Use the same CSS variables, but the hierarchy shifts:

| Element | Color | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Page background | `--color-bg` (#FFF8F0) | Warm, not white |
| Card/panel backgrounds | `--color-surface` (#F5EDE0) | For filter panels, info boxes |
| Primary data color | `--color-accent` (#2D6A4F) | Main bars, lines, bubbles |
| Secondary data color | `--color-highlight` (#D4A03C) | Second series, comparison year |
| Tertiary data color | `--color-text-muted` (#7A6E62) | Third series if needed |
| Negative/decline | `--color-error` (#C0392B) | Year-over-year decreases |
| Grid lines, axes | `--color-border` (#E8DDD0) | Subtle, not black |
| Axis labels, annotations | `--color-text-muted` (#7A6E62) | Don't use full black for chart text |

### Data Visualization Rules

1. **Chart text uses Source Sans 3**, not the browser default. Set this explicitly in D3/Plotly/whatever you're using.

2. **Axis lines and gridlines in `#E8DDD0`** (light tan), not gray or black. The warmth carries even into chart chrome.

3. **No chartjunk.** No 3D effects, no gradient fills on bars, no decorative gridlines. If a gridline doesn't help you read a value, remove it.

4. **Tooltips** should have a warm dark background (`#2A211A`) with cream text (`#F5EDE0`), matching the code block style. Border-radius `0.375rem`. Include the data value, the label, and one line of context if helpful.

```css
.tooltip {
    background: #2A211A;
    color: #F5EDE0;
    padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem;
    border-radius: 0.375rem;
    font-family: 'Source Sans 3', sans-serif;
    font-size: 0.8125rem;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(61, 43, 31, 0.15);
}
```

5. **Bubble charts:** Use border color `#3D2B1F` (dark brown) at 1-2px for definition. Fill with brand palette colors at ~80% opacity so overlapping bubbles are still readable.

6. **Tables** should alternate row backgrounds between `#FFF8F0` and `#F5EDE0`. Header row in `--color-surface` with DM Sans weight 600. Cell text in Source Sans 3. Borders in `#E8DDD0`.

```css
table {
    width: 100%;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    font-family: 'Source Sans 3', sans-serif;
    font-size: 0.9375rem;
}
th {
    background: #F5EDE0;
    font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 600;
    text-align: left;
    padding: 0.75rem 1rem;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #E8DDD0;
}
td {
    padding: 0.625rem 1rem;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #E8DDD0;
}
tr:nth-child(even) {
    background: #F5EDE0;
}
```

7. **Filter panels** are functional UI — style them to be clear and usable, not decorative. Use the card component style (surface background, border, card-radius) with standard form elements.

### Data Presentation & UX

The visual design is only half of a data site. The other half is whether the data is actually easy to understand. We want our data sites to be more thoughtful than they have to be — every number, label, and interaction should feel considered.

#### Number Formatting

**Round aggressively. Show only the precision that matters.**

- **Counts under 1,000:** Show exact (`847 listings`)
- **Counts 1,000–999,999:** Use commas, no decimals (`42,847 listings`, not `42,847.00`)
- **Counts 1M+:** Abbreviate (`3.2M records`, not `3,200,000`). One decimal max.
- **Percentages:** Zero decimals unless the difference matters. `−11%` is almost always better than `−10.81%`. Use one decimal only when values are clustered close together and you need to distinguish them (e.g., comparing 2.3% vs 2.8% turnover rates). Never two decimals.
- **Money:** Round to the nearest meaningful unit. `$4.2B` not `$4,217,483,291`. For smaller amounts, `$12.5M` or `$847K`.
- **Dates:** Human-readable. `March 2025` not `2025-03-01`. In tables where space is tight, `Mar 2025` is fine.
- **Year-over-year changes:** Use `+7.4%` and `−10.8%` (with actual plus/minus signs, not just a minus). Color-code: green for positive, red for negative. One decimal only if needed to distinguish values.

**The test:** If you showed this number to someone for two seconds, would they get it? If they'd need to count digits or parse decimals, simplify it.

#### Axis Labels & Chart Annotations

- **Abbreviate large numbers on axes:** `10K`, `20K`, `30K` — not `10,000`, `20,000`, `30,000`. The axis is for orientation, not precision. Tooltips have the exact number.
- **Don't label every gridline.** Label enough that someone can interpolate. For a 0–50K range, label 0, 10K, 20K, 30K, 40K, 50K. Not every 5K.
- **Axis titles only when the unit isn't obvious.** If the chart heading says "Job Listings by Department" and the y-axis goes 0–50K, you don't also need a y-axis label that says "Number of Job Listings." But if the unit is something like "% of appropriated funds obligated," label the axis.
- **Annotate outliers and interesting points directly on the chart** when possible, rather than making people hover. A small label next to an unusual data point is worth more than a tooltip.

#### Tables

- **Right-align numbers.** Always. This makes magnitudes comparable at a glance.
- **Left-align text.** Always.
- **Don't show more columns than people need.** If a table has 10 columns but most people care about 3, default to showing 3 with an option to expand. Don't make people scroll horizontally through data they don't want.
- **Sort by something meaningful by default.** Not alphabetically unless that's genuinely what people want. Usually sort by the most important metric, descending.
- **Include a CSV download for tables** where people might want to do their own analysis. A simple "Download CSV" link below the table. Don't make them scrape your site.

#### Interactions & Hover States

- **Every hoverable element should look hoverable.** If something changes on click or hover, it should visually signal that *before* the user tries it. Cursor change, subtle color shift, underline for links — pick one.
- **Tooltips should be fast.** No delay, no animation. Appear immediately on hover. Disappear immediately on leave.
- **Filter changes should be instant or visibly loading.** If applying a filter takes time, show a loading state. Never leave stale data on screen while new data loads behind the scenes.
- **Maintain state in the URL when feasible.** If someone filters to "Department of Agriculture" and wants to share that view, the URL should reflect the filter. Query parameters are fine.

#### Empty and Error States

- **No data for a filter combination:** Say so clearly. "No listings match these filters" is better than an empty chart with axes and no data points.
- **Data loading:** Use a simple text indicator like "Loading..." in muted text. Not a spinner animation. Not a skeleton screen.
- **Data caveats:** Put them where people will see them — near the data, not in a methodology page nobody visits. A one-line note directly below a chart ("Job listings ≠ actual hires") is more effective than a footnote.

### Data Site Header Pattern

Every data site should have:
- Site title as h1 (left-aligned)
- One line of context: what data this shows and the date range
- Links to: GitHub repo, data source, methodology (if applicable)
- Optional: a banner/notice if the data has caveats (use `--color-highlight` background with `--color-text` text)

```html
<header>
    <h1>USAJobs Listings Tracker</h1>
    <p class="site-description">Federal job listings from February to September, comparing 2024 and 2025.</p>
    <p class="site-links">
        <a href="...">GitHub</a> · <a href="...">Data source</a> · <a href="...">Methodology</a>
    </p>
</header>
```

### Data Site Footer

Minimal. One line: data source attribution, GitHub link, "Built with [tool]." No personal bio in data site footers — the site is about the data.

**But do include an attribution link.** Every data site should have a small, unobtrusive "Built by Abigail Haddad" link in the footer that points back to the personal site. This is not self-promotion — it's a thread that ties the projects together. Right now, someone who lands on the USAJobs tracker from a shared link has no way of knowing it's by the same person who writes The Present of Coding or built the FedScope dashboard. A single footer link fixes that.

```html
<footer>
    <p>Data source: <a href="...">OPM FedScope</a> · Code: <a href="...">GitHub</a> · Built by <a href="https://abigailhaddad.netlify.app">Abigail Haddad</a></p>
</footer>
```

### Visual Cohesion Across Data Sites

The USAJobs tracker, FedScope dashboard, and comment analyzer should look like they belong to the same family. They don't need identical layouts — they serve different data — but they should share:

1. **The same color palette.** Apply the brand CSS variables to every data site. This is the single biggest lever. A warm white background with forest green accents and cream panels immediately makes a site feel like part of the family, even if the layout is totally different.
2. **The same fonts.** DM Sans for headings, Source Sans 3 for body and chart text, JetBrains Mono for code. Set these explicitly in chart configurations (D3, Plotly, etc.), not just in CSS — chart libraries often ignore page-level font settings.
3. **The same table style.** Alternating warm rows, right-aligned numbers, the same border color. Tables are the most common element across data sites, so consistency here matters disproportionately.
4. **The same tooltip style.** Dark warm background, cream text. Identical across all sites.
5. **The same footer pattern.** Data source, GitHub link, attribution link. Same structure, same styling.

## Content Type: Blog Posts

Blog posts live on Substack (The Present of Coding). The visual styling is mostly controlled by Substack's platform, but the structure and voice are the brand.

### Post Structure Patterns

Posts follow one of a few recurring shapes. When drafting a new post, pick the closest pattern:

#### Pattern 1: "Here's what I built" (most common)

1. **Opening hook:** 1-2 paragraphs of context. What you were trying to do and why. Often starts with a situation: "When I left my job..." or "Over the summer, I built..."
2. **The thing itself:** Walk through what you built. Use subheadings for each major component or decision. Include screenshots, code snippets, or links to live demos.
3. **What went wrong / what surprised you:** At least one section on difficulty, failure, or unexpected lessons. This is non-negotiable — it's core to the brand.
4. **Takeaway / reflection:** Brief. 1-2 paragraphs. Don't over-moralize.

Example posts with this structure: "Hot Claude Summer," "My Cheap Side-Project Tech Stack," "My Text Pipelines Meet The Real World"

#### Pattern 2: "Here's how to do X" (tutorial/guide)

1. **Framing:** Why this matters and who it's for. Brief personal context for why you're writing it.
2. **Sections structured as: Problem → How it works → My implementation → When to use it.** This four-part pattern repeats for each topic/tool. It's the signature structure of your tutorial posts.
3. **Honest scoping:** Be clear about what this doesn't cover and where you're still figuring things out.

Example posts: "Five LLM Tricks for Data Pipelines," "Automating LLM Evaluation"

#### Pattern 3: "Here's how to think about X" (career/opinion)

1. **Personal story as entry point.** Don't start with a thesis — start with an experience.
2. **Practical, specific advice.** Not "network more" but "here's how I actually found jobs and what I looked for."
3. **Acknowledgment of what you don't know or where your experience is limited.**

Example posts: "How to Become a Government Data Scientist," "A Developer Is You," "Actually, LinkedIn Is Fine"

### Subheadings

- Use `##` (h2) for major sections. Use `###` (h3) sparingly for subsections within a long section.
- Subheadings should be short and conversational: "What makes this different," "Bubble charts and bubble math," "What I built"
- Don't number your sections (e.g., "1. Introduction" / "2. Background"). This isn't an academic paper.

### Images in Posts

- **Screenshots of your actual work** (dashboards, code, terminal output, git commit heat maps) — always good
- **Illustration-style header images** in the brand illustration style (cream background, brown outlines, flat color) — for the Substack post thumbnail
- **No stock photos.** Ever.
- **Diagrams and charts** when they clarify something. But only if they add information — don't add a chart just to break up text.

### Post Length

Most posts are 1,500–3,000 words. The structure-heavy tutorial posts (pattern 2) can run longer because the repeated Problem/How/Implementation/When pattern makes them scannable even at length. The opinion/career posts (pattern 3) tend to be shorter.

### Protecting the Structure

The recurring structural patterns (especially the "Problem → How it works → My implementation → When to use it" loop in tutorial posts) are one of the strongest and most distinctive things about the blog. They're doing enormous work for readability — they let someone scan a 3,000-word post in 30 seconds and find exactly the section they care about.

**The risk:** As topics get more complex or more narrative, the temptation is to let structure loosen — longer preambles, sections that blend together, points that span multiple subsections without clear breaks. Resist this. When a topic is complex, the structure matters *more*, not less. If a section is getting long and unwieldy, it's usually a sign that it should be split into two sections that each follow the pattern, or that the post should be split into two posts.

**The test:** Can someone scan just the subheadings and get the gist of the post? If the subheadings are generic ("Background," "Discussion," "Conclusion"), the structure has drifted. If they're specific ("Column discovery," "Theme discovery and prompt writing," "Hybrid LLM/regular expressions"), the structure is working.

### Footnotes and Asides

You use footnotes for tangents and jokes. This is part of the voice — keep doing it. Substack supports footnotes natively.

## Content Type: Presentations & Slides

Slides are built in Markdown (using Marp in VSCode or similar). The brand should show up through color, typography, and restraint — not through elaborate layouts.

### Slide Design Principles

1. **Less text, more talking.** Slides are support for what you're saying, not a transcript. If a slide has more than ~40 words, cut it.
2. **One idea per slide.** If you're making a second point, make a second slide.
3. **No slide templates with decorative headers, footers, and logos on every slide.** A clean background with content is enough. The brand comes through in color and type, not chrome.
4. **Screenshots and code are great on slides** — but make them big enough to read. If you can't read the code from the back of the room, crop it or use a smaller snippet.

### Slide Color Mapping

| Element | Color | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Background (default) | `#FFF8F0` | Warm white, not pure white |
| Background (section dividers) | `#2D6A4F` | Forest green with cream text for visual break |
| Background (code slides) | `#2A211A` | Dark warm brown, same as code blocks |
| Heading text | `#3D2B1F` | Dark brown |
| Body text | `#3D2B1F` | Same as heading, just lighter weight |
| Accent / emphasis | `#2D6A4F` | For key terms, links |
| Secondary emphasis | `#D4A03C` | For highlights, callout boxes |

### Slide Typography

- **Headings:** DM Sans, weight 600, 36-44px (adjust for content)
- **Body text:** Source Sans 3, weight 400, 24-28px
- **Code:** JetBrains Mono, 20-24px
- **Don't use more than two font sizes per slide** (heading + body). If you need a third level, you have too much content on the slide.

### Marp CSS Starter

When creating a Marp presentation with this brand:

```css
/* Marp theme for The Present of Coding */
section {
    font-family: 'Source Sans 3', sans-serif;
    background: #FFF8F0;
    color: #3D2B1F;
    padding: 40px 60px;
}

h1, h2, h3 {
    font-family: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;
    color: #3D2B1F;
}

h1 { font-size: 44px; font-weight: 700; }
h2 { font-size: 36px; font-weight: 600; }

a { color: #2D6A4F; }

code {
    font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
    background: #F5EDE0;
    padding: 2px 6px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    font-size: 0.85em;
}

pre {
    background: #2A211A;
    color: #F5EDE0;
    border-radius: 8px;
    padding: 20px;
}

/* Section divider slides */
section.divider {
    background: #2D6A4F;
    color: #FFF8F0;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
section.divider h1 {
    color: #FFF8F0;
    font-size: 48px;
}

/* Highlight box */
.callout {
    background: #F5EDE0;
    border-left: 4px solid #D4A03C;
    padding: 16px 20px;
    border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;
}
```

### Slide Structure for a Typical Talk

Based on past presentations:

1. **Title slide:** Name, talk title, event/date. Clean. No decorative graphics.
2. **Context slide(s):** Brief background. Who you are, why this matters. 1-2 slides max.
3. **Content sections:** Each introduced by a section divider slide (green background, white text, section title only). Then 3-8 content slides per section.
4. **"What went wrong" section:** Always include this. It's the brand.
5. **Closing / takeaway slide:** 1 slide. Brief. Can include links to code, blog posts, or contact info.
6. **No "Questions?" slide.** Just stop. People know they can ask questions.

## Applying This Skill

When asked to create or modify content for this brand:

1. **Read this entire document first.** Don't just grab the colors — the voice, layout principles, content structures, and anti-patterns matter as much.
2. **Identify the content type.** Is this the personal website, a data dashboard, a blog post, or a presentation? Each has different rules. The visual identity (colors, fonts) carries across all of them, but the voice, structure, and density change.
3. **For the personal website:** Use the full brand — voice, visuals, layout principles. This is where the personality lives.
4. **For data sites:** Apply the visual palette and typography to charts, tables, tooltips, and page chrome. Keep the voice minimal and functional — the brand shows up through design, not tone.
5. **For blog posts:** Follow the structural patterns. Pick the right post shape (what I built / how to do X / how to think about X). Match the voice. Include what went wrong.
6. **For presentations:** Use the Marp CSS starter. Follow the slide design principles. Less text. One idea per slide. Include a "what went wrong" section.
7. **For graphics/images:** Follow the illustration style guide — warm backgrounds, brown outlines, flat fills, limited palette.
8. **When in doubt:** Ask "Does this feel like someone's personal project or a corporate product page?" It should feel like the former.
